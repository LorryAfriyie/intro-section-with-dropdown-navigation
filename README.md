## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

Utilising image source set to be able to change an image through the image tag based on the width viewport of a screen.

```html
<img
  srcset="
    images/image-hero-mobile.png   500w,
    images/image-hero-desktop.png 1200w
  "
  src="images/image-hero-mobile.png"
  alt="hero-image"
/>
```

Using the picture tag to be able to load different images based on the size of the device width.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 40em)" srcset="images/image-hero-desktop.png" />
  <source srcset="images/image-hero-mobile.png" />
  <img src="images/image-hero-desktop.png" alt="hero-image" />
</picture>
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive navbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBMp6yUXO0) - This tutorial thoroughly explained how to make a resposive navbar, the lesson I took from this was being able to create a mobile menu that would be responsive with any mobile device viewport.

- [Dropdown menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-VeYcOCFZw) - This tutorial explained how to create a dropdown menu. The video shows the basics towards making one, and due to the expected design of this challenge's dropdown, modifications to be aligned with the styling requirements had to be made.
